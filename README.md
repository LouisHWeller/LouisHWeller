### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Louis Weller**,

a mechanical and automotive engineering Ph.D. student at the University of Stuttgart.

I'm passionate about mechanical and automotive engineering, software development, process automation and data-driven simulation solutions using machine learning (ML). I love working on projects that push the boundaries of innovation and efficiency especially for conventional physical (powertrain) simulation by integrating ML into the development toolchain.

Connect with me or get an overview of myself and my research work at my personal github.io
[website](https://louishweller.github.io).

Let's collaborate and build something amazing! ðŸš€
